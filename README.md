Project Overview

This project was created as part of my Programming Problem Solving I coursework to better understand how fundamental data structures work internally.

The goal of this project is to visualize core data structures step by step and explain what happens during each operation in plain language. By building both the logic and the visual output, I reinforced my understanding of how data is stored, accessed, and modified in memory.

Implemented Data Structures

The application currently supports visualization for the following data structures:

Arrays

Stacks

Queues

Binary Search Trees (BST)

Each data structure supports basic operations such as insertion, removal, and searching (where applicable).

Key Features

Step-by-step visualization of operations

Clear explanations describing what happens during each step

Invariant-based reasoning, such as:

Stack follows LIFO (Last In, First Out)

Queue follows FIFO (First In, First Out)

Binary Search Trees maintain ordered structure

Time complexity display for each operation (best, average, worst case)

This project focuses on correctness and understanding rather than performance or advanced UI features.

What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced and reinforced:

Implementing data structures manually without built-in libraries

Translating abstract concepts into visual representations

Writing clean, readable JavaScript logic

Explaining algorithms in simple terms

Understanding time and space complexity

Debugging logical errors step by step

Technologies Used

React

JavaScript (ES6)

HTML/CSS

No backend or database is used. All logic runs on the client side.

How to Run the Project

Clone the repository

Install dependencies:

npm install


Start the development server:

npm start


Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000

Future Improvements

Possible future extensions include:

Additional data structures (heaps, graphs)

Sorting algorithm visualizations

More detailed animations

An “interview practice” mode with questions

Optional AI-based explanations

Why This Project Matters

This project helped bridge the gap between theory and implementation. Instead of only tracing code on paper, I was able to see how data structures evolve over time, which strengthened my problem-solving skills and understanding of core computer science concepts.
