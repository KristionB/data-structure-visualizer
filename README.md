# Data Structures Visualizer

## Overview
This project was developed as part of my **Programming Problem Solving I** coursework to strengthen my understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithmic thinking.

The purpose of this application is to visualize how common data structures behave during basic operations such as insertion, removal, and searching. By implementing both the data structure logic and the visual representation, this project bridges the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation.

The focus of this project is **correctness, clarity, and step-by-step reasoning**, rather than performance optimization or advanced features.

## Supported Data Structures
The following data structures are implemented and visualized:

- Array  
- Stack (Last In, First Out)  
- Queue (First In, First Out)  
- Binary Search Tree (BST)

Each data structure supports operations appropriate to its behavior and constraints.

## Features

- Step-by-step visualization of data structure operations  
- Plain-English explanations describing:
  - What operation is occurring  
  - Why the operation behaves that way  
  - What rule or invariant is being preserved  
- Dynamic display of time complexity:
  - Best case
  - Average case
  - Worst case
- User controls for inserting, removing, and searching values

The application is designed to be easy to follow for beginners learning data structures for the first time.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I practiced and reinforced the following concepts:

- Implementing data structures manually without relying on built-in libraries  
- Translating abstract data structure behavior into visual representations  
- Writing clean, readable, and well-organized JavaScript code  
- Applying problem-solving techniques learned in Programming Problem Solving I  
- Understanding and explaining time complexity  
- Debugging logical errors through step-by-step tracing
